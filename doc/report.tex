\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction} I describe here a 
method for transmitting and receiving 20 bytes of data using audio 
frequencies. The audio is propagated between a speaker and a microphone 
in air.

The method uses 17 tones and continuous-phase frequency-shift keying. 
Frame synchronization is achieved by using the lowest tone to transmit 
a sequence with low acyclic autocorrelation, and near 50\% duty cycle. 
The remaining 16 tones encode 4 bits per symbol. Reed-Solomon code 
RS\(54,20\) is applied before modulation, to yield the 54 byte payload. 
The payload then translated to 16-tone symbols and interleaved with the 
17th synchronization tone.

On the receiving end, the demodulator uses correlation to find a 
transmitted frame. The 16 tone data symbols are decoded non-coherently, 
using Fast Fourier Transformation, and choosing the FFT bucket with the 
largest power. The symbols then transformed to half-bytes (or 
\textit{nibbles}). The received nibbles then assembled to bytes, and 
decoded using RS(54,20).

A software was written in the Python language for experimental and 
demonstration purposes. Scripts are provided to send and receive short 
text messages using the computer's audio devices, or to read/write the 
audio to/from data files. The files can be played back, or converted 
into more traditional audio formats using sox\cite{sox1}

A framework was established to gauge the performance of the software. A 
script can generate random messages and save them into audio files with 
various levels of white noise. An other script then can be used to 
attempt decoding these files. Various statistics are shown after the 
script finished decoding the files.

Simulations show that this method can transmit data 99.9\% accurately 
at a carrier to noise ratio (CNR) of -11dB (or at about 9.9dB 
$E_b/N_0$) measured over 22.05 KHz bandwidth, and with 83.4\% accuracy 
at -12dB CNR (about 8.9dB $E_b/N_0$).

In real-world experiment using a small set of consumer-grade computer 
audio devices I could achieve reliable data transfer well over 1 meter 
in a quiet room at quite low volume levels. Noisy environments mandate 
higher volume setting and/or shorter distances. \section{Theory of

\subsection{Prerequisites}

The demonstration software requires a functional Python 3.6 
installation, and a machine with enough resources. The following 
configuration \textit{before} Python installation is recommended:

\begin{itemize}
\item Intel Core i5 processor, or better
\item 4GB RAM
\item 5GB free disk space
\item Speakers
\item Microphone
\item Ubuntu Linux 17.04 or newer is recommended, a recent Windows or
macOS should also work
\end{itemize}

It is recommended to install a Python distribution called 
Anaconda\cite{ana1}.

\subsection{Installation}

The scripts \texttt{send.py} and \texttt{receive.py} use 
\textit{pyaudio}, a Python binding for an audio library called 
\textit{portaudio}, and several other libraries.

These can be installed on Ubunut Linux "zesty" 17.04 like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
$ cd <path-to-demo-software>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

On Apple macOS portaudio need to be installed using \texttt{brew}:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ brew install portaudio
$ cd <path-to-demo-software>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

On Windows, the portaudio binaries are included in the pyaudio wheel, 
so separate installation should not be necessary (make sure 
\texttt{pip} and \texttt{python} are on the \texttt{PATH}):

\begin{lstlisting}
C:\> cd <path-to-demo-software>
C:\> pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{How to Write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let

\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\label{eq:sn}
\end{equation}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

The equation \ref{eq:sn} is very nice.

\subsection{How to Make Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection{How to Make Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
\item[Word] Definition
\item[Concept] Explanation
\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}
